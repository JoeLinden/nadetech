This branch is outdated. I remade the project in TypeScript with a better file structure, more organized functions, a custom authentication solution, and a remote PostgreSQL database deployed on Vercel. A screenshot of the prototype front-end is shown in the `README.md` on the `DB-Migration` branch. This will change soon.
